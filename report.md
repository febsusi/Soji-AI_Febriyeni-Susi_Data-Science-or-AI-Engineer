Executive Summary: This report details the methodology used to extract applicability rules from AD PDFs, structures the extracted rules in a machine-readable format, and evaluates whether specific aircraft configurations are affected. In this report, Airworthiness Directives (AD) parser system testing has been completed by evaluating 10 aircraft units against two ADs, namely FAA-2025-23-53 and EASA-2025-0254.

1. Approach

I used a rule-based extraction approach utilizing regular expressions (regex) to extract specific information from the PDF Airworthiness Directives (AD) text. This method was chosen because AD documents have a relatively standard and consistent structure, allowing patterns created once to be reused repeatedly. Regex provides high precision in extracting specific information, minimizing false positives that might occur when using machine learning approaches without sufficient training data. The extraction process in this method was also performed after successfully extracting text from the PDF file using the pdfplumber library, as pdfplumber has the ability to extract text while preserving the document's original layout. I did not use alternative models such as machine learning with NER because NER requires large, labeled datasets that weren't available for this specific AD. Furthermore, I didn't use LLM-based extraction because it's computationally expensive and has high latency when processing large amounts.

2. Challenges

The biggest challenge I faced was the wide variety of formatting in AD documents and the ambiguity in the text. Nevertheless, I used a regular expression (regex) pattern to capture text between the word "Applicability" and subsequent sections such as "Subject," "Reason," "Compliance," or "Effective Date." Furthermore, I used the re.DOTALL and re.IGNORECASE flags because these patterns can capture text spread across multiple lines and ignore case differences. I also used the normalize_model() function to standardize the formatting. Excluded modifications function was used to anticipate possible spelling variations. I also set a limit on the MSN range extraction.

3. Limitations

The regex method I used has several limitations, one of which is its heavy reliance on document structure consistency. If the FAA or EASA significantly changes the AD template format, the existing regex pattern may not work properly and require adjustments. Furthermore, this method cannot handle implicit information that is not explicitly stated in the text. Furthermore, the parser cannot extract information from images, diagrams, or tables stored as images in PDFs. Given more time, some improvements I would make include developing a more comprehensive validation pipeline, developing a logging and monitoring system to detect when regex patterns fail to match text, adding the ability to extract information from tables more intelligently, and adding a versioning feature for regex patterns to track pattern changes.

4. Trade-offs

I chose not to use a Large Language Model (LLM) because LLM is non-deterministic, meaning the same model can produce different outputs for the same input at different times. In the context of aviation regulatory documents such as Airworthiness Directives, absolute consistency is crucial. Furthermore, the computational cost and scalability of LLM are high. LLM also requires a large, labeled dataset for fine-tuning to perform optimally. The reason for not using a Vision Language Model (VLM) is that the documents being processed are text-based PDFs, not scans. VLM is also very slow and expensive compared to simple text extraction. Furthermore, VLM's accuracy for text extraction from structured documents is not necessarily better than pdfplumber's because VLM can misread characters or misunderstand the document layout.
